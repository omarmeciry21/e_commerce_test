# How to Run a Flutter App

## Demo Video

You can view the demo video by clicking the link below:

[Watch the Demo Video](./path_to_video/demo_video.mkv)

Alternatively, you can use the HTML `<video>` tag if your markdown parser allows HTML rendering (e.g., GitHub, GitLab):

<video width="600" controls>
  <source src="./path_to_video/demo_video.mkv" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## Prerequisites

Before running a Flutter app, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Flutter SDK**: You can download and install Flutter from the official website: [Flutter Install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **Android Studio**: Flutter uses Android Studio for creating Android apps. You can download it from [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
- **Xcode**: For iOS development (macOS only). Download it from the App Store.
- **Visual Studio Code** (optional): A code editor that can be used to write and run Flutter apps.

You can check if Flutter is properly installed by running:

```bash
flutter doctor
